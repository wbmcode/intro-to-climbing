        <h3>Belay Device & Locking Carabiner</h3>
        <p>A belay device is a mechanical piece of climbing equipment used to control a rope during belaying. It is designed to improve belay safety for the climber by allowing the belayer to manage their duties with minimal physical effort.
          <br><br>Locking carabiners have gates that can be locked in the closed position to provide extra protection against accidental gate openings. They feature either a manual (a.k.a. screw-lock) or auto-locking system. </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Harness</h3>
        <p>Most harnesses will offer the same basic features, and the specifics don’t matter too much until you’re climbing lots or specializing in a certain style. There’s no need for a super-light harness when you’re just starting, so fit and
          comfort should be top priorities.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Chalk & Chalk Bag</h3>
        <p> Because the basic features are the same, much of choosing a chalk bag comes down to aesthetics. Let your personality shine — find a pattern or design that you like, and it will brighten your day every time you climb.</p>
