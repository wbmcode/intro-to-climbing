      <h2>Climbing Styles</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Top Ropping</h3>
        <p>Most climbing gyms involve a combination of bouldering and top roping. Top roping means that the rope is already set up through an anchor at the top of the climb prior to the climber getting on the wall. This is the safest (and often least
          scary!) type of roped climbing. <br>

      <section>
        <h3>Bouldering</h3>
        <p>A very raw form of climbing, bouldering requires only shoes, chalk, and a crash pad. Typically, these problems are on boulders under twenty feet tall and the climbing tends to involve a short sequence of very powerful moves. It is
          sometimes useful to think of bouldering as a sprint—quick and powerful—whereas other styles can be more like marathons.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Trad</h3>
        <p>Short for traditional, trad climbing is the foundational style of climbing that began prior to the practice of drilling bolts. Thus, instead of clipping into bolts that are already established (sport climbing), trad climbing involves
          placing pieces of protection (often cams or nuts) into cracks in the wall. This is a sophisticated style that involves extensive amounts of gear, a keen ability to assess risk, and confidence in one’s placements. However, despite its
          complexities, trad climbing is considered a very pure style due to its minimal impact on the natural rock</p>
