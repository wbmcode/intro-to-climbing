      <h2> Climbing shoes breakdown </h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Flat</h3>
        <p> Flat profiled shoes are ideal for beginners as they are more forgiving on weak toes and feet, but they're also suitable for multipitch routes, big wall climbing, slab climbing and crack climbing. This all comes down to comfort: the more
          natural a shoe's shape is (i.e., how it aligns with the natural shape of your foot), the longer you can wear it without pain or discomfort. In terms of technical advantages, a neutral shape is able to fluidly slot into toe jams while crack
          climbing, and it also has the greatest contact surface area for smearing.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Moderate</h3>
        <P>All-round performance comes from the middle ground. A moderate camber or even just a downturned toe will provide a balance of vertical and overhanging performance, comfort and power.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Downtown</h3>
        <p>Downturn comes into its own on anything past the vertical. On overhanging, steep territory, its arched shape, which pre-positions the foot into a "hooking" position, allows it to cling onto steep and far-away holds with much less effort
          and energy than a flat-profiled shoe would. This shape is often referred to as "aggressive", for obvious reasons.</p>
